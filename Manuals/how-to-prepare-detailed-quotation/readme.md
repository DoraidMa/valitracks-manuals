# How to Prepare a Detailed Quotation (Simple Project Offer)

This folder contains the interactive manual for Q4: "How to Prepare a Detailed Quotation" in Valitracks.

This module explains how to build an External Pricing Card using the Simple Project Offer module. 
External Pricing Cards are used when the client's quote structure does not match your internal workflow 
and you need a flexible, customizable pricing layout that can later be linked to a workflow.

This manual covers:

- What External Price Cards are and how they differ from workflow-driven quotations
- When to use Option 2: “Simple Project Offer”
- How to start a new Simple Project Offer and fill out client and project details
- How to add Sections (documents/instruments) with source & target language + locality
- How to add services to each section
- Automatic pricing extraction based on:
  • Service selected
  • Language pair
  • Country/locality
  • Pricing type (per word, fixed, minimum charge, hourly, percentage)
  • Pricing rules from the Services database
- Adding multiple services per section
- Handling multiple frameworks or methodologies per locality
- Using the duplicate function to create multi-language or multi-country versions
- Editing sections using the pencil icon to refresh pricing for new languages
- Exporting the offer as a PDF (draft)
- Accepting or rejecting offers manually or sending them to clients
- Understanding quote locking and how to reopen locked offers
- Copying entire offers for use with new clients

This module is part of the Company Owner (Team Leader) quotation workflow.
