# Interviewer Training – How to Recruit Patients Before the Translation Is Ready
Valitracks – Interviewer/Recruiter Training Module

This training video explains how Interviewers and Recruiters should add patients 
to an Invivo Testing study when the translation is not yet finalized and the 
instrument is still in the Harmonization stage.

This module is different from the PM version and focuses only on the Recruiter workflow.
