# PM Training – How to Recruit Patients Before the Language Harmonization Is Ready
Valitracks – Project Manager Training Module

This training video is created specifically for **Project Managers (PMs)**.  
It explains how PMs can start patient recruitment even when the Linguistic Validation (LV) process is still at the beginning and the translated questionnaire is not ready yet.

A **separate version of this training for Interviewers/Recruiters** will be released shortly.  
The interviewer version will focus on their workspace, recruitment flow, and specific instructions they need to follow.
