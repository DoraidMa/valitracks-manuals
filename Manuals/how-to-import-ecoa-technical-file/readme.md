# How to Import an eCOA Technical File

This guide explains how to import an eCOA technical file into Valitracks so it can be used in screen review, workflow setup, and validation steps. The import process ensures that all metadata, screen structures, and item mappings are correctly recognized by the system.

---

## 1. Access the eCOA Module
- From the left navigation menu, open **eCOA Technical Files**.
- Click **Import New File** on the top right.

---

## 2. Upload the Technical File
- Select the file provided by the eCOA vendor (XML/JSON/ZIP depending on format).
- Drag & drop or use the **Upload** button.
- Validate that the filename and format are correct before confirming.

---

## 3. System Validation Steps
After upload, Valitracks performs several automated checks:

- File structure validation  
- Screen and page recognition  
- Item mapping and metadata extraction  
- Language availability detection  
- Error checking (missing items, broken links, mismatched identifiers)

If issues are detected, the system will show a notification explaining what must be corrected before continuing.

## 4. Assign the File to a Study
- From the confirmation screen, select the study to which this file belongs.
- Link the imported eCOA file to the **Workflow**, **Screen Review**, and **In-Vivo Testing** modules.
- Save the configuration.

---

## 5. Verify the Imported Screens
- Go to **Screen Review** inside the selected study.
- Confirm that:
  - All screens are visible  
  - Item numbers match the questionnaire  
  - Navigation order is correct  
  - No errors are displayed  

Use the preview panel to scroll through the screens and ensure full alignment with the COA instrument.

## 6. What Happens Automatically
Valitracks automatically:

- Maps each screen item to the corresponding concept in the study instrument  
- Enables the Screen Review module for all assigned users  
- Makes the eCOA metadata available to PMs, team leaders, and reviewers  
- Prepares the file for version control and future updates  

---

## Purpose of This Guide
Importing the eCOA technical file early in the project ensures consistency between the paper COA, workflow steps, and the digital screen version used in eCOA systems. This step is required before performing screen review, equivalence checks, and in-vivo usability testing.
